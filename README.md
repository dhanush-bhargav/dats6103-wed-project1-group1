# Detecting Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions

This project is a machine learning-driven fraud detection system that analyzes customer transaction patterns to classify whether a credit card transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. Built using Python and core data science libraries, it simulates real-world financial fraud detection scenarios with over 1 million records and no missing values.


## Objective

To develop and evaluate supervised machine learning models to accurately classify fraudulent credit card transactions and explore the impact of various transaction behaviors on the likelihood of fraud.
